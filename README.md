# Glow-Prototype
A prototype for an experiment about changing colors of shapes. It uses Psychopy 1.83 from http://www.psychopy.org/ (Peirce 2007; 2009)

Currently, it can parse all of the information from the parameters file, but it only implements shape and color. The timing variables and their interaction with the framerate are still in development.
